## Step 1

Begin by letting your friends to vote on what distro you should install.

![Distro poll](/img/2019/gdg-poll.png "My vote was for Arch")

If they vote for Gentoo, you are now entitled to play the Gentoo Drinking Game.

Note: the two "other" votes were for Windows XP SP3 and Windows Vista.

## Step 2

Gather some friends and your laptop. Go to the pub.

## Step 3

Install Gentoo. Follow these rules:

### Take a drink...

- Every 5 minutes
- Every time you fail to do something on the first try
- Every time you have to Google something
- If you ask the bar staff if they know how to install Gentoo

### Finish your drink...

- If you mess the install up so badly you have to start again
- If you give up

### Continue playing until... 

- Gentoo has been installed
- You far too inebriated to continue
- The pub wifi proves too slow to download the Stage 3 tarball and everyone gets bored of waiting
