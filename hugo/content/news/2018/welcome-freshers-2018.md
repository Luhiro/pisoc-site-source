### Welcome to all the new freshers! 

I'd like to introduce Pi Society - shortened to PiSoc most of the time. 

We're an  society focused on computer science (occasionally maths and electrical engineering, too) - that said, anyone from any course can join. 

We run events and socials - trips, gameathons (see below), and extracurricular things like lectures (hosted by experts from the industry), install parties and hackathons. We also do fun nerdy stuff from time to time, like reverse engineering bluetooth enabled kids toys and repurposing them, or hacking together [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) bots when we're at the pub.

On Friday (21 / 09), we have a gameathon coming up - we'll be in Horton D1.24 from 2pm to 6pm, playing Overwatch and an as-of-yet-uncomfirmed game for the chance to win some [Raspberry Pis](https://www.raspberrypi.org/)! Free drinks and snacks will be provided. We'll be going to Wetherspoons afterwards for some start-of-the-semester socialising.

So, if you have questions about programming, want to learn professional skills for a career in the IT industry, or are interested in our events, come see us at the freshers fayre. We'll be on the top floor, across from the cash machine in the library. We also run weekly meetings in Horton D1.01, between 6:30pm and 8pm.

#### We hope to see you at the fayre, on friday or at one of our regular meetings!
