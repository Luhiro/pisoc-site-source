        <h2>Postponement notice</h2>

        <h3>
          Due to a change in the UoB's position on how they are handling the COVID-19 situation, we have chosen to
          postpone PiCon 2020. To reiterate, our event will not be taking place this Saturday.
        </h3>

        <h3>
          We are very sorry for any inconvenience this might cause - the decision to postpone isn't one we've taken
          lightly, as we've invested several very busy months into planning PiCon and we very much hoped it'd be a
          success.
        </h3>

        <h3>
          Rest assured that we've begun planning for our "second attempt" already. We're now looking to run PiCon 2020
          at some point during the first semester of the 2020/2021 academic year, assuming that the coronavirus outbreak
          has been sufficiently controlled by this time.
        </h3>

        <h3>
          Thank you for supporting our event. We will keep you updated as our situation progresses, and if you have any
          questions, feel free to <a href="/contact">get in contact with us</a>.
        </h3>
